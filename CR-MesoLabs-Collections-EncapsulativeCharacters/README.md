## Paren Checker
### Part 1:
Create a class with a method that verifies all parens `()` are paired.
HINT: Use a stack.

### Part 2:
Now create a method that checks that all opening characters have a closing one.

Characters include `()` `{}` `[]` `<>` `""` `''`

## WC
Write a program that counts all of the words in a file and prints out all of the words and their counts in descending order.

You can put an text file in resources and get that string's filename from

`WC.class.getResource("/filename").getFile()`

I would suggest grabbing a book from `gutenberg.org` and use that as a testing set.

Also, there is a String iterator constructor so that you can also write some tests using some data built within the tests.
