<h1>Problem 1</h1>
Write a java program to replace certain characters from a string:
    
    * Create one method that completes the task using iteration.
    * Create one method that completes the task using recursion.


UNIT TESTING IS MANDATORY !!!

<b>Example:</b>

Given the following map { ‘f’ : ‘7’, ‘s’:’$’, ‘1’:’!’, ‘a’.:’@’}, your method should replace any character represented by a key in the map, with its corresponding value.

Input = “The Farmer went to the store to get 1 dollar’s worth of fertilizer”
Output = “The 7@rmer went to the $tore to get ! doll@r’$ worth of 7ertilizer”
