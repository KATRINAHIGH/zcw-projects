# REGEX

## Directions

Make a project that will go through the hamlet file provided and using regex replace every instance of "Hamlet" with "Leon" and every instance of Horatio with "Tariq".

Beginning with tests, you are to program all the steps it will take to complete that process. Some tests have been stubbed out for you but these will not cover all the methods you should have in your project.

*IMPORTANT*: You are not to use String Utilities to simply replace words. You must use Pattern and Matcher.
